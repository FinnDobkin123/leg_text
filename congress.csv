(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:             (1) The National D-Day Museum, operated in New Orleans,          Louisiana by an educational foundation, has been established          with the vision ``to celebrate the American Spirit''.             (2) The National D-Day Museum is the only museum in the          United States that exists for the exclusive purpose of          interpreting the American experience during the World War II          years (1939-1945) on both the battlefront and the home front          and, in doing so, covers all of the branches of the Armed          Forces and the Merchant Marine.             (3) The National D-Day Museum was founded by the preeminent          American historian, Stephen E. Ambrose, as a result of a          conversation with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1963, when          the President and former Supreme Commander, Allied          Expeditionary Forces in Europe, credited Andrew Jackson          Higgins, the chief executive officer of Higgins Industries in          New Orleans, as the ``man who won the war for us'' because the          12,000 landing craft designed by Higgins Industries made          possible all of the amphibious invasions of World War II and          carried American soldiers into every theatre of the war.             (4) The National D-Day Museum, since its grand opening on          June 6, 2000, the 56th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of          Normandy, has attracted nearly 1,000,000 visitors from around          the world, 85 percent of whom have been Americans from across          the country.             (5) American World War II veterans, called the ``greatest          generation'' of the Nation, are dying at the rapid rate of more          than 1,200 veterans each day, creating an urgent need to          preserve the stories, artifacts, and heroic achievements of          that generation.             (6) The United States has a need to preserve forever the          knowledge and history of the Nation's most decisive achievement          in the 20th century and to portray that history to citizens,          visitors, and school children for centuries to come.             (7) Congress, recognizing the need to preserve this          knowledge and history, appropriated funds in 1992 to authorize          the design and construction of The National D-Day Museum in New          Orleans to commemorate the epic 1944 Normandy invasion, and          subsequently appropriated additional funds in 1998, 2000, 2001,          2002, and 2003 to help expand the exhibits in the museum to          include the D-Day invasions in the Pacific Theatre of          Operations and the other campaigns of World War II.             (8) The State of Louisiana and thousands of donors and          foundations across the country have contributed millions of          dollars to help build this national institution.             (9) The Board of Trustees of The National D-Day Museum is          national in scope and diverse in its makeup.             (10) The World War II Memorial now under construction on          the National Mall in Washington, the District of Columbia, will          always be the memorial in our Nation where people come to          remember America's sacrifices in World War II, while The          National D-Day Museum will always be the museum of the American          experience in the World War II years (1939-1945), where people          come to learn about Americans' experiences during that critical          period, as well as a place where the history of our Nation's          monumental struggle against worldwide aggression by would-be          oppressors is preserved so that future generations can          understand the role the United States played in the          preservation and advancement of democracy and freedom in the          middle of the 20th century.             (11) The National D-Day Museum seeks to educate a diverse          group of audiences through its collection of artifacts,          photographs, letters, documents, and first-hand personal          accounts of the participants in the war and on the home front          during one of history's darkest hours.             (12) The National D-Day Museum is devoted to the combat          experience of United States citizen soldiers in all of the          theatres of World War II and to the heroic efforts of the men          and women on the home front who worked tirelessly to support          the troops and the war effort.             (13) The National D-Day Museum continues to add to and          maintain one of the largest personal history collections in the          United States of the men and women who fought in World War II          and who served on the home front.             (14) No other museum describes as well the volunteer spirit          that arose throughout the United States and united the country          during the World War II years.             (15) The National D-Day Museum is engaged in a 250,000          square foot expansion to include the Center for the Study of          the American Spirit, an advanced format theatre, and a new          United States pavilion.             (16) The planned ``We're All in this Together'' exhibit          will describe the role every State, commonwealth, and territory          played in World War II, and the computer database and software          of The National D-Day Museum's educational program will be made          available to the teachers and school children of every State,          commonwealth, and territory.             (17) The National D-Day Museum is an official Smithsonian          affiliate institution with a formal agreement to borrow          Smithsonian artifacts for future exhibitions.             (18) Le Memorial de Caen in Normandy, France has formally          recognized The National D-Day Museum as its official partner in          a Patriotic Alliance signed on October 16, 2002, by both          museums.             (19) The official Battle of the Bulge museums in Luxembourg          and the American Battlefield Monuments Commission are already          collaborating with The National D-Day Museum on World War II          exhibitions.             (20) For all of these reasons, it is appropriate to          designate The National D-Day Museum as ``America's National          World War II Museum''.     (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are, through the  designation of The National D-Day Museum as ``America's National World  War II Museum'', to express the United States Government's support  for--             (1) the continuing preservation, maintenance, and          interpretation of the artifacts, documents, images, and history          collected by the museum;             (2) the education of the American people as to the American          experience in combat and on the home front during the World War          II years, including the conduct of educational outreach          programs for teachers and students throughout the United          States;             (3) the operation of a premier facility for the public          display of artifacts, photographs, letters, documents, and          personal histories from the World War II years (1939-1945);             (4) the further expansion of the current European and          Pacific campaign exhibits in the museum, including the Center          for the Study of the American Spirit for education; and             (5) ensuring the understanding by all future generations of          the magnitude of the American contribution to the Allied          victory in World War II, the sacrifices made to preserve          freedom and democracy, and the benefits of peace for all future          generations in the 21st century and beyond.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following  findings:             (1) Forces in the United States National Guard and Reserve          have made and continue to make essential and effective          contributions to Operation Iraqi Freedom and other ongoing          military operations.             (2) More than 200,000 Reserve personnel from the Army,          Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are currently          serving their Nation on active status.             (3) Our dependence on the National Guard and Reserve has          increased dramatically over the course of the past decade.          Annual duty days have grown from about 1 million in the late          1980s to more than 12 million in every year since 1996.             (4) While our dependence on the Reserves has increased in          the post-Cold War era, their basic pay and benefits structure          has remained largely unchanged.             (5) Offering TRICARE to reservists for an affordable          monthly premium enhances our national security by improving          their medical readiness when called to duty, streamlining and          accelerating the mobilization process, and enhancing our          military's ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to          reserve duty.             (6) The Congressional Budget Office, the official,          nonpartisan scorekeeper of all congressional legislation, has          estimated the cost of this proposal at just over one-tenth of          one percent of the Administration's fiscal year 2004 defense          budget request.             (7) On May 20, 2003, a strong majority of Senate Democrats          and Republicans joined together and voted 85-10 for an          amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Defense authorization bill to          provide reserve personnel and their families access to TRICARE          regardless of their current deployment status.             (8) The Appropriations Committee indicated in its report          accompanying the fiscal year 2004 Defense appropriations bill          that it supports this proposal.     (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--             (1) the National Guard and Reserve play a critical and          increasingly demanding role in protecting our national          security; and             (2) the Senate supports the Appropriations Committee          position as articulated in the report accompanying the fiscal          year 2004 Defense appropriations bill and affirms its support          for providing Guard and Reserve personnel access to TRICARE.

108_hr2658_eas,108th,"Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004",Sec. 8165.," (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:             (1) If a terrorist group were to acquire the necessary          fissile material for a nuclear explosive device, it would not          be difficult for the group to construct such a device, the          explosion of which could kill and injure thousands, or even          hundreds of thousands, of people and destroy a large area of a          city.             (2) If a terrorist group were to acquire a complete nuclear          weapon from a nation which has constructed nuclear weapons, it          is likely that the group would be able to detonate the device          with similar results.             (3) A nation supplying either complete nuclear weapons or          special nuclear material to terrorists might believe that it          could escape retaliation by the United States, as the United          States would not be able to determine the origin of either a          weapon or its fissile material.             (4) It is possible, however, to determine the country of          origin of fissile material after a nuclear explosion, provided          that samples of the radioactive debris from the explosion are          collected promptly and analyzed in appropriate laboratories.             (5) If radioactive debris is collected soon enough after a          nuclear explosion, it is also possible to determine the          characteristics of the nuclear explosive device involved, which          information can assist in locating and dismantling other          nuclear devices that may threaten the United States.             (6) If countries that might contemplate supplying nuclear          weapons or fissile material to terrorists know that their          assistance can be traced, they are much less likely to allow          terrorists access to either weapons or material.             (7) It is in the interest of the United States to acquire a          capability to collect promptly the debris from a nuclear          explosion that might occur in any part of the Nation.     (b) Sense of the Senate on Nuclear Debris Collection and Analysis  Capability.--It is the sense of the Senate that--             (1) the Secretary of Defense should develop and deploy a          nuclear debris collection and analysis capability sufficient to          enable characterization of any nuclear device that might be          exploded in the United States;             (2) the capability should incorporate airborne debris          collectors, either permanently installed on dedicated aircraft          or available for immediate use on a class of aircraft,          stationed so that a properly equipped and manned aircraft is          available to collect debris from a nuclear explosion anywhere          in the United States and transport such debris to an          appropriate laboratory in a timely fashion; and             (3) to the maximum extent practicable, the capability          should be compatible with collection and analysis systems used          by the United States to characterize overseas nuclear          explosions.     (c) Report.--Not later than March 31, 2004, the Secretary of  Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report  on the feasibility of developing and deploying the capability described  in subsection (b)(1).
